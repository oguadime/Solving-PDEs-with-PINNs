# Solving-PDEs-with-PINNs
A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the basic implementation and principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

# Description 
This notebook explores the concept of Physics-Informed Neural Networks, a method that integrates physical laws (expressed as PDEs) into the training process of neural networks. PINNs are particularly useful for solving forward and inverse problems in scientific machine learning where traditional numerical solvers are costly or impractical.
The notebook demonstrates:
 - Problem definition for a simple PDE (e.g., Poisson, heat, or wave equation)
 - PINN architecture setup
 - Loss formulation combining data loss and PDE residual loss
 - Training process and solution visualization

# Features 
 - Define differential equation(s) and initial/boundary conditions
 - Construct and train a neural network model to approximate the solution
 - Visualize training metrics and predicted solution
 - Compare neural solution vs. analytical/numerical ground truth (if available)
